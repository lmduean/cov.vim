A few of quick commands to open *.gcov.html files with w3m quickly.

:COV opens the corresponding *.gcov.html(generated by lcov and genhtml) for current file being edited.  
:COVHOME opens the coverage report homepage(generated by lcov and genhtml) for current project.  
:COVRBLT rebuild the coverage report for current project.  

Edit your .vimrc, add these variables(relative path to your project), for example:
> let g:COVReportDirectory = "build/coveragereport"  
> let g:COVRebuildCommand = "!mkdir -p build && cd build &&  
> \ cmake3 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=coverage -DCODE_COVERAGE=on .. &&  
> \ make -j && make test && make coverage"  

See [here](https://code.cor-lab.de/projects/rsc/repository/revisions/master/entry/cmake/Modules/EnableCoverageReport.cmake) for how to enable coverage report for your project.
